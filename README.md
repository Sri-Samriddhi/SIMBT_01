# SIMBT_01
TASK #01
Create a 2D array to represent the game board. This array will hold the X's
and O's that are placed by the players.
Create a method to print the game board. This method will iterate through
the 2D array and print out the X's, O's, and blank spaces.
Create a method to handle player moves. This method will prompt the player
to enter their move (row and column) and then update the game board with
their choice.
Create a method to check for a winner. This method will check the 2D array
for three in a row of X's or O's. If a winner is found, the game will end and the
winner will be declared.
Create a main method to run the game. This method will initialize the game
board, loop through player turns, and call the other methods to update the
game board, check for a winner, and print the game board. The game will
continue until a winner is found or the game ends in a tie.
